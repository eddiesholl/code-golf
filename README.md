# Usage
For now, the tests can be used to exersize the solutions and algorithms

# Exersizes
## missing-integer
This exersize is to find exactly one gap in a sequence of integers. The input integers are not ordered, but the boundary of the numbers is known up front. The numbers can be expected to be well formed
